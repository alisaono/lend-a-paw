## :scroll: Description
<!--- Describe your app in one or two sentences -->
Lend a paw is a handy adoption app to increase correspondence between our furry friends who're searching for a family and families who are searching for a furry family member.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
<!--- Optionally point readers to interesting parts of your submission. -->
<!--- What are you especially proud of? -->
One of the design choices was to allow users to scroll through profile detail pages for better user accessibility. This design avoids having the user select a profile detail and backing out to the general detail page to select another profile. The proudest design choice implemented is creating the custom layout class to display a grid of fluffy photos with their paw-sitively adorable names.
